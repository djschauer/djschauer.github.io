# Train Scheduler

This is a very simple app that lets a user add different trains, inputing various values for the name, its destination, frequency and arrival. The program saves these trains in a database and tracks them over time and displays their information in real time.

## How to Use

Simply go to the page and add any trains that you would like to keep track of via the form on the page.

Note: You will need to know all of the trains information, including the first train (or the first point at which you want to keep track) and how frequently the train stops.
