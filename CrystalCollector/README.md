# Crystal Collector

Crystal Collector is a simple game. The program will generate a random number on the screen, and the user will have to click the various crystals, which will add to the users score depending on which crystal was clicked. However, the amount that each crystal is worth is determined randomly and will be different every game. The goal is to get the two numbers to match.
