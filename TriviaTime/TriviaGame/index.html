    <h1>Welcome to Dan's Super Good Quiz</h1>
    <p>
        You will have thirty seconds to answer each question. The questions will all be multiple choice. (Careful, some of them are tough!)
    </p> 
    <p>
        Choose an answer by clicking on the text before the 15 seconds have elapsed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you answered correctly (yay!), you will be sent to the next question and your score will be updated
    </p>
    <p>
        If you answered incorrectly or you ran out of time (boo!), then you will be sent (shamefully) to the next question and your score will be updated.
    </p>
